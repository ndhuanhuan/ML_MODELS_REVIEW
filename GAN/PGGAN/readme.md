# Progressive GAN Basics
## Progressive growing and smoothing of higher-resolution layers
In technical terms, we are going from a few low-resolution convolutional layers to many high-resolution ones as we train. Thus, we first train the early layers and only then introduce a higher-resolution layer, where it is harder to navigate the loss space. We go from something simple—for example, 4 × 4 trained for several steps—to something more complex—for example, 1024 × 1024 trained for several epochs.

The problem in this scenario is that upon introducing even one more layer at a time (for example, from 4 × 4 to 8 × 8), we are still introducing a massive shock to the training. What the PGGAN authors do instead is smoothly fade in those layers, in order to give the system time to adapt to the higher resolution.

However, rather than immediately jumping to this resolution, we smoothly fade in this new layer with higher resolution by a parameter alpha (α), which is between 0 and 1. Alpha affects how much we use either the old—but upscaled—layer or the natively larger one. On the side of the D, we simply shrink by 0.5x to allow for smoothly injecting the trained layer for discrimination.

## Mini-batch standard deviation
Let’s recall the issue of mode collapse, which occurs when the GAN learns how to create a few good examples or only slight permutations on them. We generally want to produce the faces of all the people in the real dataset, maybe not just one picture of one woman.

Therefore, Karras et al. created a way for the Discriminator to tell whether the samples it is getting are varied enough. In essence, we calculate a single extra scalar statistic for the Discriminator. This statistic is the standard deviation of all the pixels in the mini-batch that are generated by the Generator or that come from the real data. That is an amazingly simple and elegant solution: now all the Discriminator needs to learn is that if the standard deviation is low in the images from the batch it is evaluating, the image is likely fake, because the real data has more variance. The Generator has no choice but to increase the variance of the generated samples to have a chance to fool the Discriminator
