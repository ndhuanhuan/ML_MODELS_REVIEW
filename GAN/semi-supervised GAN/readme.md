## Intro
Semi-supervised learning is one of the most promising areas of practical application of GANs. Unlike supervised learning, in which we need a label for every example in our dataset, and unsupervised learning, in which no labels are used, semi-supervised learning has a class label for only a small subset of the training dataset. By internalizing hidden structures in the data, semi-supervised learning strives to generalize from the small subset of labeled data points to effectively classify new, previously unseen examples. Importantly, for semi-supervised learning to work, the labeled and unlabeled data must come from the same underlying distribution.
