# Basics

```
pd.DataFrame({'Bob': ['I liked it.', 'It was awful.'], 
              'Sue': ['Pretty good.', 'Bland.']},
             index=['Product A', 'Product B'])
```

Looks like:

|             | Bob  | Sue |
|-------------| ------------- | ------------- |
|Product A| I liked it.  | Pretty good  |
|Product B| It was awful.| Bland.  |
